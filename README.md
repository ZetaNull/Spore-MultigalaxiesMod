# Zeta's Multigalaxies v2

A basic multiple galaxies mod based on Groxxy's template. Will likely have more added to it in the future, though is mainly just cleaner than previous iterations on the concept.

You can get between galaxies via either wormholes or "Interstellar Highways," long spaghettilike paths of stars.

The Grox probably have a relatively larger amount of territory near the center of the galaxy, though this is just because the central galaxy is scaled down a bit. I may change this later.

You can download the mod in the Releases page.
